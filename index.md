# -Welcome!-

My name is Jack, andI've decided to compile all of my projects from game engines into a nifty little collection for anyone to see!

Feel free to take a look around. Feedback of any kind is greatly appreciated.


## Source Engine

## Garry's Mod

### Prison Environment

A dull environment taking the form of a Prison Block, set somewhere outside a cityscape, This was a scenic test I worked on over the span of a few weeks

## Team Fortress 2

### Achievement_Idle_2_Floors
My [only released TF2 Map.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2207478744) I know, I know, it's an ach_idle map, but it was a neat idea at the time, and I was quite happy with it for a while, until I remade it last year

### CTF_Dominance

An old TF2 Map I worked on for a while. Taking inspiration from ctf_haarp and ctf_2fort, I wanted to change the playstyle of the condensed, close quatered ctf layout

## GameMaker Studio II

### Six Feet Thunder: Genesis (No, not based on the CoTN song i've heard that reference so much it hurts)

An idea I had one day about making a Platformer/Endless Shooter where you "Euthanize Furries"

Project's still under development so don't expect it to be out anytime soon

97% of the art in this project was made by myself

### Bragging Time

An idea I had where you try and get a special screen by testing your luck against a Random Number Generator that has the same odds as ***Winning the Lottery***

### Underground Tunnels

My first proper S2 project, based on compact underground tunnels, It was a test of Hammer's toolsset to see how it fared from Source 1's Toolset

### Waiting Room

My most recent project, based on a real location near where I live, i made it with scenic and gamemode lobbies in mind (although it probably won't hold up to gamemodes as such)

## Unreal 4

### Tower

This is a puzzle game i made for my Colleges' Final Major Project, It's a small and rushed game, but I didn't have much time to work on it properly
